I was making some Michaelsoft Binbows edits. Went through a bit of research and found the font/a similar font from a reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/identifythisfont/comments/tkz4xl/whats_michaelsoft_binbows_font_identifying_the/). It was a huge hassle for me to get the font especially since the particular font seemed to only be accessible through a Japanese app (even though it's free). Putting it here for people going through the same problem and are not from Japan, if you have a problem with this being up, I can just bring it down.
