DISCLAIMER: I do not own the rights to this font.

I was making some Michaelsoft Binbows edits. Went through a bit of research and found the font/a similar font from a reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/identifythisfont/comments/tkz4xl/whats_michaelsoft_binbows_font_identifying_the/). It was a huge hassle for me to get the font especially since the particular font seemed to only be accessible through a Japanese app. Putting it here for people going through the same problem and are not from Japan. IDK whether this goes against any copyright, but if the company / japanese app that owns the rights to this font has a problem with it I can just bring it down.
